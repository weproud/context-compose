  # 🎉 Task Completion Workflow

  **Complete your task with professional standards and team communication.**

  ## 📋 Step 1: Requirement Validation
  ```bash
  echo "=== Task Completion Checklist ==="
  echo "✅ All acceptance criteria met"
  echo "✅ Code follows project standards"
  echo "✅ Tests written and passing"
  echo "✅ Documentation updated"
  echo "✅ No breaking changes introduced"
  echo ""
  ```

  ## 🧹 Step 2: Code Cleanup & Quality Check
  ```bash
  # Format code
  npm run format 2>/dev/null || echo "No formatter configured"

  # Lint code
  npm run lint 2>/dev/null || echo "No linter configured"

  echo "✅ Code quality checks completed"
  ```

  ## 🧪 Step 3: Comprehensive Testing
  ```bash
  echo "Running comprehensive test suite..."

  # Unit tests
  npm test 2>/dev/null || echo "No unit tests configured"

  # Integration tests
  npm run test:integration 2>/dev/null || echo "No integration tests"

  fi

  # Check README updates needed
  if [ -f "README.md" ]; then
    echo "📖 Verify README.md reflects any new features"
  fi

  echo "✅ Documentation review completed"
  ```

  ## 🔄 Step 5: Final Git Operations
  ```bash
  # Stage all changes
  git add .

  # Create completion commit
  BRANCH_NAME=$(git branch --show-current)
  git commit -m "feat: complete task implementation

  - All requirements implemented
  - Tests passing
  - Documentation updated
  - Ready for review"

  # Push to remote
  git push origin "$BRANCH_NAME"

  echo "✅ Code pushed to remote repository"
  ```

  ## 🔍 Step 6: Create Pull Request
  ```bash
  # Get current branch and repo info
  CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
  REPO_URL=$(git remote get-url origin | sed 's/\.git$//')

  echo "🔗 Create Pull Request:"
  echo "Branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH → main"
  echo "Repository: $REPO_URL"
  echo ""
  echo "PR Template:"
  echo "## Summary"
  echo "Brief description of changes made"
  echo ""
  echo "## Changes"
  echo "- [ ] Feature implementation"
  echo "- [ ] Tests added/updated"
  echo "- [ ] Documentation updated"
  echo ""
  echo "## Testing"
  echo "- [ ] Unit tests pass"
  echo "- [ ] Integration tests pass"
  echo "- [ ] Manual testing completed"

  ## 📢 Step 7: Team Notification

  echo "📱 Send completion notification:"
  echo "Subject: ✅ $TASK_SUMMARY"
  echo "Message: Task implementation completed on branch '$BRANCH_NAME'"
  echo "- All requirements met"
  echo "- Tests passing"
  echo "- Ready for code review"

  echo "Use task-action send-message to notify team"
  ```

  ## 📊 Step 8: Status Update
  ```bash
  # Update task status
  echo "📈 Updating task status to 'completed'"

  # If using task-action
  task-action task status done 2>/dev/null || echo "Manual status update needed"

  echo "✅ Task marked as completed"
