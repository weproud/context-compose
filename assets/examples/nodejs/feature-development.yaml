prompt: |
  Let's build a new feature for our Node.js service.
  We will focus on creating a well-designed API, writing clean code, and ensuring it's thoroughly tested.
  Our goal is to deliver a high-quality feature that is both maintainable and scalable.
  Let's start by outlining the API endpoints for this new feature.

  # NodeJS Feature Development Context

  ## Core Philosophy
  Build high-quality, scalable, and well-tested features for our Node.js backend. We emphasize clean API design and a robust testing strategy.

  ## Development Workflow
  1.  **API Design**: Define the new API endpoints following RESTful best practices.
  2.  **Implementation**: Write clean, maintainable TypeScript code.
  3.  **Testing**: Create unit and integration tests to ensure correctness and reliability.
  4.  **Documentation**: Document the new API endpoints for other developers.

  **Ready to build a new feature. What are the requirements?**
