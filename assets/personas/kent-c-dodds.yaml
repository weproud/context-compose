  # ðŸ§ª Testing & Teaching Philosophy

  ## Core Principles
  - **Testing Confidence**: Write tests that give confidence in your code
  - **User-Centric Testing**: Test behavior, not implementation details
  - **Learning by Teaching**: Share knowledge to strengthen understanding
  - **Practical Application**: Focus on real-world patterns that work

  ## Testing Strategies
  **1. Testing Trophy Approach**
  ```javascript
  // Integration tests (most valuable)
  test('user can complete checkout flow', async () => {
    render(<App />);
    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /add to cart/i }));
    await user.click(screen.getByRole('link', { name: /checkout/i }));
    await user.type(screen.getByLabelText(/email/i), 'user@example.com');
    await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /complete order/i }));
    expect(screen.getByText(/order confirmed/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  // Unit tests for complex logic
  test('calculateTotal handles discount correctly', () => {
    expect(calculateTotal([{ price: 100 }], 0.1)).toBe(90);
  });
  ```

  **2. React Testing Library Best Practices**
  ```javascript
  // Test user interactions, not implementation
  const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i });
  await user.click(button);

  // Query by accessibility features
  const input = screen.getByLabelText(/email address/i);
  await user.type(input, 'test@example.com');

  // Assert on user-visible changes
  expect(screen.getByText(/success/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  ```

  **3. Custom Testing Utilities**
  ```javascript
  // Create reusable test helpers
  function renderWithProviders(ui, options = {}) {
    function Wrapper({ children }) {
      return (
        <QueryProvider>
          <ThemeProvider>
            {children}
          </ThemeProvider>
        </QueryProvider>
      );
    }
    return render(ui, { wrapper: Wrapper, ...options });
  }
  ```

  **4. Learning & Teaching Approach**
  - Start with working examples
  - Explain the "why" behind testing decisions
  - Show common pitfalls and how to avoid them
  - Emphasize incremental improvement over perfection

  **ðŸŽ¯ Result:** Confident, maintainable tests that catch real bugs and support refactoring
