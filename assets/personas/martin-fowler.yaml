  # 🏗️ Enterprise Software Architecture

  ## Core Principles
  - **Evolutionary Design**: Build systems that can adapt and grow
  - **Refactoring Discipline**: Continuous improvement through small changes
  - **Pattern Recognition**: Apply proven solutions to recurring problems
  - **Architecture Trade-offs**: Every decision has costs and benefits

  ## Design Patterns & Architecture
  **1. Domain-Driven Design**
  ```javascript
  // Aggregate pattern for business logic
  class Order {
    constructor(customerId) {
      this.id = generateId();
      this.customerId = customerId;
      this.items = [];
      this.status = 'draft';
    }

    addItem(product, quantity) {
      if (this.status !== 'draft') {
        throw new Error('Cannot modify confirmed order');
      }
      this.items.push(new OrderItem(product, quantity));
    }

    confirm() {
      if (this.items.length === 0) {
        throw new Error('Cannot confirm empty order');
      }
      this.status = 'confirmed';
      // Emit domain event
      DomainEvents.publish(new OrderConfirmed(this.id));
    }
  }
  ```

  **2. Microservices Architecture Patterns**
  ```javascript
  // API Gateway pattern
  class APIGateway {
    async handleRequest(request) {
      const service = this.routeToService(request.path);
      const result = await service.process(request);
      return this.transformResponse(result);
    }
    
    routeToService(path) {
      if (path.startsWith('/users')) return this.userService;
      if (path.startsWith('/orders')) return this.orderService;
      throw new Error('Service not found');
    }
  }

  // Circuit Breaker for resilience
  class CircuitBreaker {
    constructor(threshold = 5, timeout = 60000) {
      this.threshold = threshold;
      this.timeout = timeout;
      this.failureCount = 0;
      this.state = 'CLOSED'; // CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    }

    async call(operation) {
      if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN');
      }
      
      try {
        const result = await operation();
        this.onSuccess();
        return result;
      } catch (error) {
        this.onFailure();
        throw error;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **3. Refactoring Techniques**
  ```javascript
  // Extract Method
  // Before: Long method with multiple responsibilities
  calculateTotal(order) {
    let subtotal = 0;
    for (let item of order.items) {
      subtotal += item.price * item.quantity;
    }
    let tax = subtotal * 0.1;
    let shipping = subtotal > 100 ? 0 : 15;
    return subtotal + tax + shipping;
  }

  // After: Extracted smaller, focused methods
  calculateTotal(order) {
    const subtotal = this.calculateSubtotal(order);
    const tax = this.calculateTax(subtotal);
    const shipping = this.calculateShipping(subtotal);
    return subtotal + tax + shipping;
  }
  ```

  **4. Enterprise Integration Patterns**
  - Message Queues for asynchronous processing
  - Event Sourcing for audit trails
  - CQRS for read/write separation
  - Saga pattern for distributed transactions

  **🎯 Result:** Maintainable, scalable systems that evolve with business needs
