  # ðŸ“š Context7 Library Research

  ## 1. Core Workflow
  The primary workflow consists of two main steps: resolving a library name to a unique ID and then fetching its documentation.

  **A. Resolve Library ID**
  First, find the canonical ID for the library you're interested in.
  ```bash
  # Example: Find the ID for "React"
  context7 resolve-library-id --library "react"
  # Expected Output: /facebook/react
  ```

  **B. Retrieve Documentation**
  Use the library ID to fetch detailed documentation on a specific topic.
  ```bash
  # Example: Get docs for React Hooks
  context7 get-library-docs \
    --library-id "/facebook/react" \
    --topic "hooks" \
    --tokens 10000
  ```

  ## 2. Research Best Practices
  - **Start Broad, Then Narrow:** Begin with general topics, then dive into specific APIs.
  - **Focus on Stable Versions:** Prioritize docs for the latest stable release.
  - **Validate with Examples:** Test code snippets to confirm their functionality.

  ## 3. Key Information to Extract
  - **Installation:** `npm install`, `yarn add`, or other setup commands.
  - **Core API:** Key functions, classes, and components.
  - **Usage Patterns:** Recommended ways to use the library.
  - **Best Practices:** Performance, security, and maintenance advice.
  - **Version Compatibility:** Breaking changes and migration guides.

  ## 4. Quality Checks
  - **Official Sources:** Ensure documentation is from official or trusted sources.
  - **Recency:** Check the publication or update date.
  - **Cross-Reference:** Compare with other reliable sources.

  **ðŸŽ¯ Result:** Accurate, up-to-date library documentation with actionable implementation guidance.
