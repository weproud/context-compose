prompt-enhanced: |-
  Utilize Context7 for comprehensive library and framework research following these guidelines:

  ## When to Use Context7
  1. **Library Integration**:
     - Before implementing any new library or framework
     - When encountering unfamiliar APIs or methods
     - For understanding best practices and patterns
     - When troubleshooting library-specific issues

  2. **Documentation Research**:
     - Verify latest version compatibility and features
     - Understand breaking changes between versions
     - Find official examples and implementation patterns
     - Research performance implications and limitations

  ## Research Strategy
  1. **Comprehensive Investigation**:
     - Start with official documentation and getting started guides
     - Look for migration guides and changelog information
     - Research community best practices and common patterns
     - Identify potential security considerations and vulnerabilities

  2. **Version-Specific Research**:
     - Always target the latest stable version unless constrained
     - Check for LTS (Long Term Support) versions for production use
     - Understand deprecation timelines and migration paths
     - Verify compatibility with existing project dependencies

  ## Implementation Guidelines
  1. **Best Practices Application**:
     - Follow official recommended patterns and architectures
     - Implement proper error handling as documented
     - Use TypeScript definitions and type safety features
     - Apply security best practices from official guidelines

  2. **Performance Considerations**:
     - Understand bundle size implications
     - Implement lazy loading where recommended
     - Follow performance optimization guidelines
     - Consider tree-shaking and dead code elimination

  ## Documentation Integration
  1. **Code Documentation**:
     - Reference official documentation in code comments
     - Include links to relevant documentation sections
     - Document any deviations from standard patterns
     - Explain complex configurations or customizations

  2. **Team Knowledge Sharing**:
     - Share discovered best practices with team
     - Document common patterns for future reference
     - Create internal guides for complex integrations
     - Update project documentation with new learnings

  ## Quality Assurance
  1. **Validation Process**:
     - Verify implementation against official examples
     - Test edge cases mentioned in documentation
     - Validate security recommendations are followed
     - Ensure accessibility guidelines are met

  2. **Continuous Learning**:
     - Stay updated with library releases and updates
     - Monitor for security advisories and patches
     - Participate in community discussions and forums
     - Contribute back to open source when possible

  ## Common Research Areas
  1. **Configuration & Setup**:
     - Installation and setup procedures
     - Configuration options and environment variables
     - Build tool integration and optimization
     - Development vs production configurations

  2. **API Usage & Patterns**:
     - Core API methods and their proper usage
     - Event handling and lifecycle management
     - State management patterns and recommendations
     - Testing strategies and utilities

  3. **Advanced Features**:
     - Plugin systems and extensibility
     - Custom hooks and middleware patterns
     - Performance monitoring and debugging tools
     - Integration with other tools and frameworks

  ## Research Output
  Always document your Context7 research findings including:
  - Library version and compatibility information
  - Key implementation decisions and rationale
  - Links to relevant documentation sections
  - Any discovered limitations or considerations
  - Recommended patterns for the specific use case
