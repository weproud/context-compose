enhanced-prompt: |-
  **Use systematic sequential thinking to break down and solve complex problems step-by-step.**

  ## Sequential Thinking Process
  1. **Problem Definition:**
     - Clearly define the problem or task at hand
     - Identify goals, constraints, and success criteria
     - Gather all relevant context and requirements
     - List assumptions and dependencies

  2. **Problem Decomposition:**
     - Break complex problem into smaller, manageable parts
     - Identify sequential steps and parallel tasks
     - Map dependencies between different components
     - Prioritize steps by importance and logical order

  3. **Solution Design:**
     - Design approach for each sub-problem
     - Consider multiple solution alternatives
     - Evaluate trade-offs and potential risks
     - Select optimal approach for each step

  4. **Step-by-Step Execution:**
     - Execute one step at a time in logical order
     - Validate results before proceeding to next step
     - Document decisions and reasoning at each stage
     - Adjust approach based on intermediate results

  ## Thinking Framework
  **For Each Step:**
  - **Input**: What information/resources are needed?
  - **Process**: What actions will be taken?
  - **Output**: What result is expected?
  - **Validation**: How will success be verified?
  - **Next Steps**: What depends on this step's completion?
