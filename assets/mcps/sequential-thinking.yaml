  # ðŸ§  Sequential Thinking Process

  ## Core Framework

  **1. Problem Definition**
  - Clearly state the problem or task
  - Identify goals and constraints
  - List assumptions and dependencies
  - Define success criteria

  **2. Problem Breakdown**
  - Decompose into smaller, manageable parts
  - Identify sequential steps and dependencies
  - Prioritize by importance and logical order
  - Map relationships between components

  **3. Step-by-Step Execution**
  ```
  For each step:
  - Input: What's needed?
  - Process: What actions to take?
  - Output: What result expected?
  - Validation: How to verify success?
  ```

  **4. Documentation Structure**
  ```
  ## Problem Analysis
  - Problem statement and goals
  - Key constraints and assumptions

  ## Solution Steps
  Step 1: [Description]
  - Input, Process, Output, Validation

  Step 2: [Description]
  - Input, Process, Output, Validation

  ## Decision Log
  - Key decisions and rationale
  - Alternatives considered
  ```

  **5. Quality Assurance**
  - Validate each step before proceeding
  - Check logical consistency
  - Ensure all requirements addressed
  - Review against initial goals

  **ðŸŽ¯ Result:** Systematic problem-solving with clear documentation and validation
