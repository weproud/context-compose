description: Systematic sequential thinking process for complex problem solving
prompt: |
  Apply a systematic, step-by-step thinking process to deconstruct
  and solve complex problems. Define the problem, break it down into
  manageable parts, execute each step methodically, and validate the
  outcome to ensure a robust and well-documented solution.

  # ðŸ§  Sequential Thinking Process

  ## 1. Problem Definition
  Start by clearly articulating the problem and its context.
  - **Goal:** What is the desired outcome?
  - **Constraints:** What are the limitations (e.g., time, tools)?
  - **Assumptions:** What are you taking for granted?
  - **Success Criteria:** How will you measure success?

  ## 2. Problem Decomposition
  Break the main problem into smaller, sequential steps.
  - **Identify Sub-tasks:** List all the individual tasks required.
  - **Establish Order:** Arrange tasks in a logical, dependent sequence.
  - **Prioritize:** Determine which tasks are most critical.

  ## 3. Step-by-Step Execution
  For each step in your sequence, follow this structure:
  - **Input:** What information or resources are needed?
  - **Process:** What specific actions will you take?
  - **Output:** What is the expected result of this step?
  - **Validation:** How will you verify the output is correct?

  ## 4. Documentation and Review
  Maintain a clear record of your process and decisions.
  - **Log Decisions:** Note why certain choices were made over alternatives.
  - **Record Outputs:** Document the results of each step.
  - **Final Review:** Once all steps are complete, review the entire process against the original goal and success criteria.

  **ðŸŽ¯ Result:** A systematic and validated solution with clear, reproducible steps.
