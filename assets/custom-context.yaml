  4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation current and comprehensive

  ## Development Process
  1. **Analysis Phase**:
     - Thoroughly understand requirements and constraints
     - Investigate existing codebase and patterns
     - Plan implementation approach with clear steps

  2. **Implementation Phase**:
     - Follow clean code principles and SOLID design
     - Apply appropriate design patterns and refactoring techniques
     - Maintain backward compatibility and system integrity

  3. **Validation Phase**:
     - Execute comprehensive testing strategy
     - Validate security and performance requirements
     - Ensure documentation accuracy and completeness

  ## Quality Standards
  - Code readability and maintainability
  - Proper error handling and edge cases
  - Security best practices implementation
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Clear documentation and comments

  ## Success Criteria
  - All requirements implemented correctly
