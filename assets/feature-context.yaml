  # Feature Development Context

  ## Development Philosophy
  Implement high-quality functionality through **user-centric thinking** and **incremental development**.

  ## Development Process
  1. **Requirements Analysis & Design**:
     - Write and review feature specifications
     - Define user stories and acceptance criteria
     - Plan technical design and architecture
     - Design APIs and data modeling

  2. **Incremental Development (MVP → Complete)**:
     - Start with Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
     - Maintain working versions at each stage
     - Collect and incorporate early feedback
     - Expand and improve features iteratively

  3. **Quality Assurance**:
     - Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD)
     - Write unit/integration/E2E tests
     - Conduct code reviews and pair programming
     - Verify performance and accessibility requirements

  ## Development Focus Areas
  - **User Experience**: Intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces
  - **Performance**: Fast response times and efficient resource usage
  - **Accessibility**: Features accessible to all users
  - **Scalability**: Structure capable of handling future requirements
  - **Security**: Safe and reliable functionality
  - **Maintainability**: Readable and easily modifiable code

  ## Technical Considerations
  - **API Design**: Follow RESTful principles, consistent response formats
  - **Database**: Efficient schema design, index optimization
  - **Frontend**: Component reusability, state management optimization
  - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly messages

  ## Documentation Requirements
  - **Feature Specifications**: Detailed feature descriptions and usage
  - **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
  - **User Guide**: Guide for end users
  - **Developer Documentation**: Code structure and extension methods

  ## Success Criteria
  - ✅ All acceptance criteria met
  - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (90%+)
  - ✅ Performance targets achieved (response time < 200ms)
  - ✅ Accessibility standards compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - ✅ Security verification completed
  - ✅ Code review approved
  - ✅ Documentation completed
