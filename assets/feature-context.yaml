  Let's build something new and exciting.
  We will transform a great idea into a high-quality, user-centric feature.
  Our process will be agile and iterative, focusing on delivering value quickly.
  We'll balance innovation with solid engineering, ensuring our work is scalable and maintainable.
  Let's start by defining the user stories and acceptance criteria.

  # Feature Development Context

  ## Core Philosophy
  We build features with the user in mind, following an incremental and test-driven approach. Quality, scalability, and maintainability are built-in from the start, not bolted on at the end.

  ## Development Lifecycle
  1.  **Define**: Clearly articulate the problem, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
  2.  **Design**: Create a technical plan, considering architecture, data models, and APIs.
  3.  **Build**: Implement the feature, starting with an MVP and iterating. Write clean, well-structured code.
  4.  **Test**: Apply the testing pyramid (unit, integration, E2E) to ensure quality.
  5.  **Document**: Write clear documentation for both users and developers.

  ## Key Considerations
  - **User Experience (UX)**: Is it intuitive and accessible?
  - **Performance**: Is it fast and efficient?
  - **Security**: Is it secure against common threats?
  - **Code Quality**: Does it adhere to our standards (Clean Code, SOLID)?

  ## Success Criteria
  - ✅ All acceptance criteria are met.
  - ✅ Comprehensive test suite with high coverage (90%+).
  - ✅ Positive code review and architectural approval.
  - ✅ Performance and security benchmarks are met.
  - ✅ Complete and clear documentation.
