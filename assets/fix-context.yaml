  Let's track down and squash this bug.
  We will systematically analyze the problem to find the root cause.
  Our goal is a minimal, precise fix that resolves the issue without side effects.
  We'll write a regression test to ensure this bug never returns.
  Let's start by reliably reproducing the issue.

  # Bug Fixing Context

  ## Core Philosophy
  We approach bug fixing with a methodical and analytical mindset. The goal is not just to patch the symptom, but to understand and eliminate the root cause, preventing recurrence.

  ## Bug Squashing Process
  1.  **Reproduce**: Reliably reproduce the bug. An unreproducible bug cannot be fixed.
  2.  **Analyze**: Isolate the problem. Use logs, debuggers, and deductive reasoning to pinpoint the root cause.
  3.  **Fix**: Implement the smallest possible change that corrects the issue.
  4.  **Test**: Write a specific test that fails before the fix and passes after. Run all relevant regression tests.
  5.  **Verify**: Confirm the fix resolves the original problem and introduces no new issues.

  ## Key Principles
  - **Minimal Change**: Avoid unrelated changes. Focus solely on the fix.
  - **Root Cause Analysis**: Don't just treat the symptom.
  - **Regression Testing**: Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality.
  - **Clear Documentation**: Document the bug, the cause, and the solution.

  ## Success Criteria
  - ✅ The bug is fully resolved and verified.
  - ✅ A regression test has been added.
  - ✅ All related tests pass.
  - ✅ The fix is documented.

  **Ready to eliminate this bug. How can we reproduce it?**
