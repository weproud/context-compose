# Context Compose

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for AI Development Workflows**

## üéØ Why Context Compose?

While PRDs (Product Requirements Documents) provide overall project descriptions, they lack the detailed context needed for specific development tasks. Each development unit (feature, fix, refactor, docs, etc.) requires its own contextual guidance to maintain consistency and quality.

Context Compose was born from the idea of creating a composable system - like Docker Compose or GitHub Actions - where you can mix and match only the components you need for each specific task.

**The Problem:**

- PRDs are too high-level for granular development work
- Developers constantly switch between different types of tasks requiring different mindsets
- Inconsistent approaches across team members for similar tasks
- Repetitive context-setting for AI assistants

**The Solution:**
Context Compose provides task-specific contexts that can be composed together, ensuring consistent, high-quality development practices across your entire team.

## ÔøΩüõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Creating Custom Contexts

1. **Create a new context file** in `.contextcompose/`:

```yaml
# .contextcompose/my-custom-context.yaml
version: 1
kind: task
name: 'my-custom-workflow'
description: 'Custom context for specific project needs'

context:
  workflow: workflows/custom-workflow.yaml
  roles:
    - roles/domain-expert.yaml
  rules:
    - rules/project-specific.yaml
    - rules/company-standards.yaml
  mcps:
    - mcps/custom-tools.yaml
prompt: |
  Custom instructions for this specific context...
```

2. **Create supporting files**:

```yaml
# .contextcompose/roles/domain-expert.yaml
version: 1
kind: role
name: domain-expert
description: Domain-specific expertise

prompt: |
  You are a domain expert with deep knowledge of:
  - Industry-specific patterns
  - Regulatory requirements
  - Business logic constraints
```

```yaml
# .contextcompose/rules/project-specific.yaml
version: 1
kind: rule
name: project-specific-rules
description: Project-specific development rules

prompt: |
  ## Project-Specific Guidelines

  1. **Architecture Patterns**:
     - Use hexagonal architecture
     - Implement CQRS for complex domains

  2. **Code Standards**:
     - Follow company naming conventions
     - Use specific logging formats
```

### Customizing Existing Contexts

1. **Override default contexts** by creating files with the same name:

```yaml
# .contextcompose/default-context.yaml
version: 1
kind: task
name: default
description: Customized default context for our team

context:
  workflow: workflows/team-workflow.yaml
  roles:
    - roles/senior-developer.yaml
  rules:
    - rules/team-standards.yaml
    - rules/security-first.yaml
```

2. **Extend contexts** by referencing base contexts:

```yaml
# .contextcompose/extended-feature-context.yaml
version: 1
kind: task
name: extended-feature
description: Feature development with additional constraints

extends: feature-context.yaml

context:
  rules:
    - rules/compliance-requirements.yaml
    - rules/accessibility-standards.yaml
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations

```yaml
# .contextcompose/environments/production.yaml
version: 1
kind: environment
name: production
description: Production deployment context

context:
  rules:
    - rules/production-safety.yaml
    - rules/monitoring-requirements.yaml
  notify:
    - notify/ops-team.yaml
```

### Team Collaboration

1. **Share contexts via version control**:

   - Commit `.contextcompose/` directory to your repository
   - Team members automatically get consistent contexts

2. **Organization-wide contexts**:

   - Create organization templates
   - Distribute via npm packages or git submodules

3. **Role-based access**:
   - Different contexts for different team roles
   - Junior vs senior developer contexts
   - Specialized domain contexts
